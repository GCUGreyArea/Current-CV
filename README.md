## Work experience:

### Senior Software Engineer / Team lead / Technical lead

### Alert Logic**

October 2021 – present
Job description:
As a member of the parsing team, I am responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining components implemented in Erlang and C++ 11 using the Native Implemented Functions (NIF) interface. The parser is a high-performance component that offloads message parsing from an Erlang-based system to a C++ component as a shared library deployed on Amazon EC2 infrastructure and loaded on demand by the system. 

System development and testing are done using DTrace and XCode Instruments. Compilation uses Erlang 24, make, and c++17. Local validation tools are hosted in Docker and run on Amazon Linux.

**Achievements:**

•	Increased overall performance of the library by around 15%. 
•	Developed a translation system for a tree-based rule approach.
•	Added Google Test framework for component-level test-driven development, which was excluded by the Erlang common test framework. 
•	Currently redesigning parsing engine architecture.


### Senior Software Engineer / Product Lead 

### Genesis Technical Systems**

July 2018 – October 2021

**Job description:**
Product lead, responsible for project planning, delivery, and architecture, working in an Agile team to deliver products in a mixed hardware and software environment.

Also developed a Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) tool for managing and deploying Genesis equipment using OpenDaylight, a java-centric container architecture based on Apache Karaf. The project is a mixture of java 11 development for server-side systems and embedded C/C++ development for embedded controller architecture.

Design and development of the Access Service Manager (ASM) platform, a telecoms TR101 accesses node at the Central Office for a product range that aggregates and extends reach in xDSL networks from the DSLAM. I designed and developed the control system for the FPGA engine and the network interface device driver for packet routing to and from the physical interfaces. 

This included IGMP group participation, DHCP negotiation, and rate limiting through QoS.

Support and implement functionality in existing prototype products built in DPDK 18.05 and on the Netronome Agilio CX in MicroC for deployment in technical trials.

Work with FPGA and hardware design engineers to develop bespoke system boards and software for FPG engine on the Xilinx ZCU106 running on a Zynq Ultrascale+ Quad-core ARM A53 processor.

Design, implement and modify components such as Command Line Interface (CLI) and Operations Administration and maintenance (OAM) systems build using Yang models to define MIBs and management capabilities accessed through Netconf and SNMP. 

Develop an architecture to provide a fully realisable CORD node deployable in AT&T’s Airship environment.

Responsible for designing and developing a high availability element management system, GEMS2 (Genesis Element Management System Version 2), in Java 11, employing distributed message queues.

**Achievements:**

•	Implemented embedded Layer 2 packet generation and processing components on a Netronome Agilio CX in MicroC, a C99/80 target-specific real-time subset of the C language compiler for the Netronome Agilio CX SmartNIC hardware platform. 
•	Developed a QoS system for a product based on DPDK 18.05 used as a TR101 node and improved overall packet processing efficiency in PMD.
•	Planned, managed, and contributed to the development of an FPGA based embedded system for a TR101 access node, ASM-10.
•	Researched and developed a strategy for integration into CORD and AT&T Airship, for Genesis products. 

Skills: C/C++, Java 8 / 11, Maven, eclipse, visual studio, P4, Netronome MicroC / SoC System Architecture, DPDK 18.05, Layer 2/3 packet processing (UDP/IGMP/ARP/PPPoE), xDSL, u-boot, Xilinx board bring up, Xilinx ZCU106 development board bring up with petalinux and buildroot.   

### Freelance developer, consultant, mentor, and trainer
2001 to 2018

Worked as a freelance developer, trainer, and mentor working in Java, J2EE, C/C++, and assembler, as well as product integration and testing for a range of clients from blue chip companies to local small businesses providing both technical tuitions, mentoring and consultancy as well as business research and development and business process re-engineering.

During this time, I undertook work for BEA (WebLogic/J2EE training as an external consultant), BAA, DEL, and OtherMedia (business consultancy / BPR). 
I also ran a successful photography business in my spare time.

### Senior Consultant

### Valtech UK Ltd

Job Description:
Development of internal and external B2B e commerce solutions, systems and full development life cycle training, mentoring, including sales support through presales consultancy and development of whiteboard architectures.

Main Accomplishments:
•	Trained newly hired employees using a "boot camp" originally developed for the initial intake at Riversoft. I repurposed the concept to reduce expenditure by Valtech on newly hired consultants, sourcing intelligent graduate candidates, and training them to the high
•	technical standards required by the company to deliver the best possible solutions to clients.
•	This strategy allowed us to reduce overall hire spend for the year through reduced wages demanded by seasoned professionals with the experience to command high salaries.

•	Led a team to examine and propose solutions for ongoing attacks to the company's internal network, and external servers. At the time Valtech held sensitive information for multiple banking and financial institutions worldwide, as well as proprietary internal data. The team produced a report that formed part of that year's business strategy and was subsequently published as part of the general business plan for Valtech UK.
•	Provided presales consultant to evaluate customer system requirements, and formulate whiteboard architectures for potentially viable systems solutions to secure high value contracts.
•	Developed architectures for several systems that were later implemented for blue chip clients.
•	Delivered training and mentoring in the use of development methodologies and programming languages and technologies including Rapid Iterative Prototyping using
•	Object Oriented Design & Development, Unified Modelling Language, J2EE, both in house and on customer sites.
•	Was instrumental in identifying and exiting from a non-profitable contract that would have locked the company into a long term, and potentially damaging contract, to provide backup consultancy services to a second party consultancy group.
•	Developed the information systems architectures for blue chip clients.

Personal Statement:
At RiverSoft (and more recently in Genesis) I was the first employee through the door in the morning, and the last one to leave at night. My faith and hard work in the company was rewarded with 175,000 shares which were given to me personally by two of its senior board members, and personal friends [Sir Campbell Frasier - Chairman of Dunlop 1971, Head of the CBI 1981, and Sir Trevor Robinson CBE - Trevor Robinson & Co].

I have a lifetime fascination with the way in which science shapes technology, and how technology shapes our world. From climate change to quantum computing and its impact on applications such as cryptography, cyber security, and AI.
