barry.w.robinson64@gmail.com – 0777 079 1061 – Birmingham

I have worked on large, highly scalable software projects written from the ground up in C/C++ as
well as working on higher-level business systems in Java EJB.
I have managed and mentored teams of six or more developers and worked as a senior
consultant for large multinational companies, as well as delivering training and mentoring in EJB. I
learn new technologies quickly and I am always looking for new challenges.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Senior Software engineer

### Alert Logic by Help Systems


As a member of the parsing team, I am responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of components
implemented in Erlang and C++ 11 using the Native Implemented Functions (NIF) interface. The parser is a
high-performance component that offloads message parsing from an Erlang-based system to a C++ component as a
shared library deployed on Amazon EC2 infrastructure and loaded on demand by the system.

System development and testing are done using DTrace and XCode Instruments. Compilation uses Erlang 24, make,
and c++11. Local validation tools are hosted in Docker and run on Amazon Linux.

Development of internal and external B2B e commerce solutions, systems and full development
life cycle training, mentoring , including sales support through presales consultanc y and
development of whiteboard architectu re s.

## Main Accomplishments:

- Trained newly hired employees using a "boot camp" originally developed for the initial intake at
    Riversoft. I repurposed the concept to reduce expenditure by Valtech on newly hired consultants,
    sourcing intelligent graduate candidates, and training them to the high
- technical standards required by the company to deliver the best possible solutions to clients.
- This strategy allowed us to reduce overall hire spend for the year through reduced wages demanded
    by seasoned professionals with the experience to command high salaries.
- Mentored internal and external employees in the development large multiuser system with a
    combination of Rapid Iterative Prototyping and Object-Oriented Designed Methodologies [UML] to
    deliver scalable, multiuser, multi-threaded systems deployed with J2EE and other distributed
    component technologies.
- Developed Java/J2EE B2B solutions for both internal and external client and stakeholders.
- Led a team to examine and propose solutions for ongoing attacks to the company's internal
    network, and external servers. At the time Valtech held sensitive information for multiple banking
    and financial institutions worldwide, as well as proprietary internal data. The team produced a report
    that formed part of that year's business strategy and was subsequently published as part of the
    general business plan for Valtech UK.
- Provided presales consultant in order to evaluate customer system requirements, and formulate
    whiteboard architectures for potentially viable systems solutions in order to
- secure high value contracts.
- Developed architectures for a number of systems that were later implemented for blue chip clients.
- Delivered training and mentoring in the use of development methodologies and programming
    languages and technologies including Rapid Iterative Prototyping using
- Object Oriented Design & Development, Unified Modelling Language, J2EE, both in house and on
    customer sites.
- Was instrumental in identifying and exiting from a non-profitable contract that would have locked
    the company into a long term, and potentially damaging contract, to provide backup consultancy
    services to a second party consultancy group.
- Developed the information systems architectures for blue chip clients.

At RiverSoft (and more recently in Genesis) I was the first employee through the door in the
morning, and the last one to leave at night. My faith and hard work in the company was rewarded
with 175,000 shares which were given to me personally by two of its senior board members, and
personal friends [Sir Campbell Frasier - Chairman of Dunlop 1971, Head of the CBI 1981, and Sir
Trevor Robinson CBE - Trevor Robinson & Co].

I have a lifetime fascination with the way in which technology shapes our world, and maintain a
several meta-blogs through "Flipboard" on various subjects ranging from quantum computing
and its impact on applications such as cryptography and cyber security, to mobile technologies,
AI, and emerging technologies like Internet of things. The way in which our world is constantly
changing, and its implications is a fascinating subject.

I'm also a professional photograp he r, and currently run a business providing authentic social
media content and stock photograp h y to large and small organisations [through New Street
Photograp h y], as well as business and systems consultancy [through New Street Creatives].
